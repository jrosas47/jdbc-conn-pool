Cassandra JDBC Connection Pool inspired on Hector Pool-of-pools and failover arquitecture.

NOTE: It is still under development.

Some of the features are:

 o JNDI discovery
 o failover behavior on the client side
 o connection pooling for improved performance and scalability
 o JMX conters for monitoring and management
 o configurable and extensible load balancing with three algorithms to choose from: round robin (the default), least active, and a phi
    -accrural style response time detector
 o automatic retry of downed hosts
 o automatic discovery of additional hosts in the cluster
 o suspension of hosts for a short period of time after several timeouts
